# mini-projects
This is a repo containing a bunch of miniature coding projects done for school and other things.

Each file has a comment at the start describing what is in it and why it was made.

Not everything I have done for school is in here, as I am not entirely sure what I am allowed
to upload and what is considered "course content". I have tried to be safe and only upload exercise-type
coding projects. The courses I have taken so far were focused on Racket and C.

Feel free to use anything in here without permission. If you want to credit me, put my name 
in a comment or something. Enjoy!
